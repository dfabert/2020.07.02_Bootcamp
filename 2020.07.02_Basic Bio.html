    <body><p>Glen goes by Derick, which has been a curse his whole life.  His Dad's name is Glen Eric and had the same struggle his entire life, but decided to pass it along to Derick.  Derick's wife is not in favor of passing it along to the next generation.
    </p>
    <p>Derick is from Brooklyn, IN and graduated from Purdue with a bachelors degree in atomospheric science.  He spent the next 10 years after graduation being a broadcast meteorologist.  While he loves the science, he didn't love the hours.  He currently is a real estate representative for a billboard company.</p>
